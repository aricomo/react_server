#React with webpack and express
I tried to connect Client-side and Server-side React with ECMAScript on React + Express + webpack.
This is the example how to run React component through express rewuest, response concept.
After the process of server side rendering, I tried to render the same component at the client side.

This is just simple example, that you can click button to increase the number from initial value.
